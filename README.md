# Icklenote

Made in Lazarus 4.2. Uses the RichMemo package. 

A little text viewer and editor that I use mainly for searching text files.

Portable app, no install needed. 

Put the exe in the folder that contains the text files you want to view/edit. 

You can run any number of instances in different folders at the same time. 

The window position and size and the font used for plain text are saved when you exit. 

You can also use RTF files, but this is not very tested so there may be problems. 

To be expanded.
